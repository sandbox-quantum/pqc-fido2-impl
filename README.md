# PQC FIDO2
In this project, we add support for post-quantum algorithms on FIDO2. We implemented Dilithium3 for Signing in WebAuthn and Kyber768 for KEM in CTAP2. The current implementation only supports discoverable (resident) credentials.

FIDO2 involves three main entities:

1. authenticator,
2. browser and
3. server.

We needed to change all these three entities. In our prototype, we use Nitrokey 3 firmware for `authenticator`, Firefox browser and `java-webauthn-server` from Yubico.

## Setup

Clone this repository and its submodules.

```
git clone git@github.com:sandbox-quantum/pqc-fido2-impl.git --recurse-submodules
```

## Web Authentication Server

### Build `liboqs-java`

*Note*: You have to build `liboqs` first.

Go to `liboqs-java/`, and follow the [Building the OQS dependency](https://github.com/sandbox-quantum/liboqs-java_fork#building-the-oqs-dependency) instructions.

Next, follow the [Building the Java OQS wrapper instructions](https://github.com/sandbox-quantum/liboqs-java_fork#building-the-java-oqs-wrapper):

```
mvn package -P macosx -Dliboqs.include.dir="/usr/local/include" -Dliboqs.lib.dir="/usr/local/lib"
```

### Start Java Web Auth Server

Go to `java-webauthn-server/`, run:

```
./gradlew run
```

## Firefox browser with PQC authenticator

Follow the instructions [here](docs/firefox.md) (make sure you have [`Mercurial`](https://pypi.org/project/mercurial/) installed first) to embed the modified PQC authenticator into Firefox.


## Hardware Authenticator

The [LPC55 Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-3-firmware/blob/main/docs/lpc55-quickstart.md) explains how to compile and flash the firmware on a LPC55 Nitrokey 3 Hacker device or on a LPCXpresso55S69 development board.

### Nitrokey 3 Hacker

Once the device is reset and provisioned following the [LPC55 Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-3-firmware/blob/main/docs/lpc55-quickstart.md), the firmware can be flashed using the following command line:

```console
make -C utils/lpc55-builder flash FEATURES=develop
```

### LPCXpresso55S69

Hardware setup:

- [LPCXpresso55S69](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/lpcxpresso-boards/lpcxpresso55s69-development-board:LPC55S69-EVK) development board and 2 USB cables.

- Connect 2 USB cables to two ports: P9 High-Speed ("High Spd" label) and P6 Debug Probe ("Debug Link" label).

- Install the [SEGGER J-Link software bundle](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)

- Open the SEGGER J-Link Configuration program and make sure the J-Link protocol is being used
>  The board should appear in the list of devices connected via USB. We will be using the J-Link communication protocol. Therefore, in case the board appears as using the CMSIS-DAP protocol (the default in a new board), we will need to install the J-Link firmware by following [these steps](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/lpc-link-2/). After restart, the board should show up in the configuration tool as a J-Link device. 

![SEGGER J-Link](images/jlink.png)

Go to the `nitrokey-3-firmware/` directory and from 2 terminals:

- Terminal 1: `make -C utils/lpc55-builder/ jlink`
- Terminal 2: `make -C utils/lpc55-builder/ run FEATURES=develop-no-press`

To verify that the board is working as a hardware authenticator, we use the `fido2-token` tool from `libfido2`:

```
‚ùØ fido2-token -L
ioreg://4295801683: vendor=0x20a0, product=0x42b2 (Nitrokey Nitrokey 3)
```


## Test

1. Visit https://localhost:8443 in the Firefox browser and click on the "Create account with passkey" button. This will initiate the registration process using a resident key.

![Alt text](images/create_account.png)

Select "Proceed" and, if prompted for it, click the **USER** button on the board / tap the Nitrokey 3 Hacker board.

Output of the successful registration.

![Alt text](images/create_account_success_di3.png)

In our experiment, Dilithium3 ID is `-20`, you can see it in our [patched COSEY module](https://github.com/sandbox-quantum/cosey_fork/blob/pqc_kyber768_dilithium3/src/lib.rs#L76)

The string `DIL3`, `Dil` or `Dilithium` should appear in the server logs.


2. For authentication click "Authenticate with passkey" or "Authenticate with username" to authenticate with the corresponding resident key.

Select "Proceed" and click the **USER** button on the board  / tap the Nitrokey 3 Hacker board.

![Alt text](images/auth.png)

Output of the successful authentication. Again, the string `DIL3`, `Dil` or `Dilithium` should appear in the server logs.

### Troubleshooting

* MACOS:  In case of errors related to `liboqs` in the server, make sure `OpenJDK@17` is used (or any other version supporting `aarc64`) and add a symlink for `liboqs.5.dylib`:  

```console
ln -s /usr/local/lib/liboqs.5.dylib /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk@17/17.0.9/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/server/liboqs.5.dylib
```
